When i have heard for the first time about R, i was a student in Bsc in agronomy in Ivory Coast. My professor of statistics just told me that R was great comparing to other statistical software and gave me the link to the site of the comprehensive R archive network. Nobody could help me learn or know more on R in Ivory Coast from my attempts to find peoples to help me.  
       
So one day searching on internet, going from links to links, i have found R-bloggers and Rstudio. After that found Hadley Wickham and begin to get interested really on learning R.  

The best things i have found in R is that R is also one of the best community around in every ways that could help a beginR growing in R. All i know on R today comes from posts, links, helps, tips and encouragment from the R community.  

To stay current with the R community i mostly used Twiiter. Twitter is one of the key tools used by the R community, and we can add blogs and websites, but i clearly recommend to beginR to have a [twitter](https://twitter.com) account and to follow and get involved in the R community.  

After this first step, if you plan to do a carreer in data science or relative fields you should [start a blog](http://varianceexplained.org/r/start-blog/) and visit regularly others blogs and websites.  

Below, i have put a list of peoples, blogs and websites that help me and continue to be a great source of infoRmations to stay current. This list is reflect my own point of view and surely lack some importants links you probably think as important (please leave a comment below) and don't forget that this list is just a *at least list*.  

While this post aims to help beginR, it could also be of good help for more experienced useRs. This post will be updated at least every year to help peoples.  

### Hashtags 

Usually, on twitter you should use the hashtags `#rstats`, `#R` or `#rstudio` to find out what is going around R. You should also learn to use [rtweet](https://cran.r-project.org/).

### Finally  

One of the benefits of be engaged with the community is helpful and useful links that comes with tweets. I think that you cannot correctly grow in your learning of R without being engaged with the R community. So this little article take place as an advice if you plan to learn, to get involved or learn more in R. I can say that if you want to know what is going in R you just have to open your twitter page and read your feed.
